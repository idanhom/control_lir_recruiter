# LinkedIn Recruiter Enhanced Navigation UserScript

## Description

This UserScript is designed to enhance the user experience on LinkedIn Recruiter by enabling keyboard navigation and interaction. It provides a more efficient way to navigate profiles, expand sections, and perform common actions without relying on the mouse.

## Features

- **Profile Navigation**: Navigate forwards (`s`, `k`) and backwards (`a`, `j`) between profiles.
- **Profile Scrolling**: Scroll up (`c`, `n`) and down (`v`, `m`) within the profile view.
- **Expand Skills**: Display all skills of a candidate (`r`).
- **Expand Work Experiences**: Reveal additional work experiences of a candidate (`e`).
- **Hide/Unhide Profiles**: Toggle the visibility of profiles (`f`, `ö`).
- **Toggle See More/Less**: Expand or collapse extended text sections (`g`, `ä`).
- **Message Candidates**: Access the message button to communicate with candidates (`Spacebar`).
- **Save to Pipeline**: Add candidates to your recruitment pipeline (`d`, `l`).

## Installation

1. Install a UserScript manager extension in your browser (e.g., Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey).
2. Create a new script in the UserScript manager.
3. Copy and paste the entire code of this script into the new script section in the UserScript manager.
4. Save the script.

## Usage

Navigate to LinkedIn Recruiter (`https://www.linkedin.com/talent/hire/*`). The script will run automatically. Use the designated keyboard shortcuts to interact with the page:

- `a` or `j`: Navigate to the previous profile.
- `s` or `k` or `Mouse Button 5': Navigate to the next profile.
- `d` or `l`: Save the current profile to the pipeline.
- `f` or `ö`: Hide or unhide the current profile.

- `r`: Expand all skills.
- `e`: Show more work experiences.

## Notes

- The script does not trigger when the focus is on an input, textarea, or contenteditable element.
- LinkedIn's website updates may affect the script's functionality. Regular updates or checks might be required.
